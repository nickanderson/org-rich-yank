#+TITLE: org-rich-yank

[[https://melpa.org/#/org-rich-yank][https://melpa.org/packages/org-rich-yank-badge.svg]]

Do you often yank source code into your org files, manually
surrounding it in =#+BEGIN_SRC= blocks? This package will give you a
new way of pasting that automatically surrounds the snippet in blocks,
marked with the major mode of where the code came from, and adds a
link to the source file after the block.

* Installation

** MELPA
If you use [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], you can just do =M-x list-packages=, find
=org-rich-yank= in the list and hit =i x=.

** Manual
Just put =org-rich-yank.el= somewhere in =load-path=.


* Usage

** Manual, loading on startup:

To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
interactive function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-rich-yank)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-M-y") #'org-rich-yank)
#+END_SRC

** With use-package, enabled after org:

If you prefer =use-package=, the above settings would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-rich-yank
  :ensure t
  :demand t
  :bind (:map org-mode-map
              ("C-M-y" . org-rich-yank)))
#+END_SRC

The =:demand t= in there is because we never know when the user will
hit =C-M-y=, so we always have to store the current buffer on
kills. You can remove the =:demand t= and have lazy/deferred loading,
but then the first time you hit =C-M-y= after startup, you'll get a
message that you have to kill the selection again.

** Configuring link prefix

If you want to prefix the link to the source location you can do so by defining =org-rich-yank-link-prefix=. For example, links to local files might be useful in your org document but not so useful in exported content, so you may want to make the link a /comment/ line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (customize-set-variable 'org-rich-yank-link-prefix "#+comment: ")
#+end_src

Configuring the variable as above results in the following content being pasted:

#+begin_example
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; URL: https://github.com/unhammer/org-rich-yank
  ;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4"))
  ;; Keywords: convenience, hypermedia, org
  ,#+END_SRC
  ,#+comment: [[file:~/src/org-rich-yank/org-rich-yank.el]]
#+end_example
